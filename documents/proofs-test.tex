\section{Local Redundancy}
We first consider an example first posed by Postan:
\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$L_2$: $P(A)$}
\AxiomC{$\eta_2$: $\neg P(x)$, $\neg Q(x, B)$}
\BinaryInfC{$\neg Q(x,  B)$}
\AxiomC{$\eta_1$: $\neg P(z)$, $Q(z,y)$}
\BinaryInfC{$\neg P(z)$}
\AxiomC{$L_1$: $P(x)$}
\BinaryInfC{$\bot$}
\end{prooftree}
Which is locally redundant; see the compressed version in his document.

\section{``Example 2''}
We consider example 2, from the LU/RPI paper, modified for first order predicates in a trivial way:
\begin{prooftree}
\def\fCenter{\mbox{\ $\vdash$\ }}

\AxiomC{$\eta_1$: $\neg P(A)$}
\AxiomC{$\eta_3$: $P(A),Q(B)$}
\BinaryInfC{$\eta_4$: $Q(B)$}
\AxiomC{$\eta_2$: $P(A), R(C), \neg Q(B)$}
\BinaryInfC{$\eta_5$: $P(A), R(C)$}
\AxiomC{$\eta_1$: $\neg P(A)$}
\BinaryInfC{$\eta_6$: $R(C)$}

\AxiomC{$\eta_4$: $Q(B)$}
\AxiomC{$\eta_7$: $P(A), \neg Q(B), \neg R(C)$}
\BinaryInfC{$\eta_8$: $P(A), \neg R(C)$}
\AxiomC{$\eta_1$: $\neg P(A)$}
\BinaryInfC{$\eta_9$: $\neg R(C)$}

\BinaryInfC{$\bot$}
\end{prooftree}

\subsection{Lower Units}
Proceeds exactly the same as in the paper.\\
{\bf TODO:} show exact steps? \\

\subsection{RecyclePivots}
Again, proceeds like in the paper. 

\section{Lower Units}
\subsection{Research Notes}
First, I consider the proofs 1-5 that were provided by Bruno on the Skeptik dev mailing list. In order to be explicit, I outline the case of compression from proof 1 to proof 2:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lower $P(X)$ so that the terms using it were resolved against each other instead of with $P(X)$
\item Contract (trivially?); the unifier resulted in the duplicated terms
\item Resolve the contracted formula against the lowered unit, $P(X)$
\end{itemize}

The result is a trade of a resolution for a contraction, which is more compact (when we consider compactness as a count of the number of resolution rules).

In order to generalize, I think the best place to start was see under what conditions we can in fact make this contraction. It should not be required that contraction results in duplicated formulas; indeed, as long as a contraction is possible this seems to work. So in particular, I conjecture that we should lower a unit formula if and only if for all formulas which would be resolved against the unit clause of interest are pair-wise unifiable (disregarding the remainder of their premises), and unifiable with the unit. Further, the unit must be the most general form of the formula, as the following shows:

\begin{prooftree}
\def\e{\mbox{\ $\vdash$\ }}
\AxiomC{\e$P(y,x)$}
\AxiomC{$P(A,x)$ \e $Q(A),R(B)$}
\BinaryInfC{\e $Q(y), R(B)$}
\AxiomC{$Q(y)$ \e $Q(x)$}
\BinaryInfC{\e $R(B), Q(x)$}

\AxiomC{$Q(A), P(y,A)$\e}
\AxiomC{\e$P(y,x)$}
\BinaryInfC{$Q(x)$\e}

\BinaryInfC{\e$R(B)$}
\AxiomC{$R(B)$\e}

\BinaryInfC{$\bot$}
\end{prooftree}

but if we delay the resolution with $P(y,x)$ we get

\begin{prooftree}
\def\e{\mbox{\ $\vdash$\ }}
\AxiomC{$P(A,x)$\e $Q(A),R(B)$}
\AxiomC{$Q(y)$ \e$Q(x)$}
\BinaryInfC{$P(y,x)$\e$Q(x),R(B)$}

\AxiomC{$Q(A), P(y,A)$\e}
\BinaryInfC{$P(y,x), P(x,y)$\e $R(B)$}
\AxiomC{$R(B)$\e}
\BinaryInfC{$P(y,x),P(y,A)$\e}
\AxiomC{\e $P(y,x)$}
\BinaryInfC{$P(y,x)$}
\AxiomC{\e $P(y,x)$}
\BinaryInfC{$\bot$}
\end{prooftree}

and now we actually the same number of resolution rules. No, we can still use a contraction, and reduce the proof.

The requirement for being pairwise unifiable is also seen in proof 1 and 2, but further, this is lacking the case of proof 3: $P(a)$ and $P(b)$ is not unifiable, and thus proof 5 is not actually compressed. But if $P(b)$ had been $P(B)$, then we would have been fine. It also fails in the following example:

\begin{prooftree}
\def\e{\mbox{\ $\vdash$\ }}
\AxiomC{\e $P(X)$}
\AxiomC{$P(a)$\e$Q(Y),R(Z)$}
\BinaryInfC{\e$Q(Y),R(Z)$}
\AxiomC{$R(X),P(b)$\e $S(Y)$}
\BinaryInfC{$P(b)$\e $S(Y),Q(Y)$}
\AxiomC{$S(Y), Q(Y)$\e}
\BinaryInfC{$P(b)$\e}
\AxiomC{\e $P(X)$}
\BinaryInfC{$\bot$}
\end{prooftree}

which is the 'potentially' globally reduction example from the original lower units paper.\\

\subsection{Results}
Let $\clause{x}$ denote a clause consisting of the formula $x$.

\begin{thm}
Let $S$ be the set of premises being resolved against a unit clause $u$. Then $u$ can be lowered if, for every distinct $\eta_1,\eta_2 \in S$, $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$ are unifiable.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We proceed by induction. Base case: $|S|=1$. In this case, the unit $\clause{u}$ is only involved in exactly one resolution; let $\clause{\eta}$ be the premise resolved against $\clause{u}$ so that we have $P=\phi[\phi_1[\phi_\eta[\eta] \odot_{\sigma} \phi_u[u]] \odot_{\sigma_r}  \phi_r[r]]$. Note that $\clause{\eta}$ contains $\clause{\overline{u}'}$, a negated version of $\clause{u}$, which would be resolved out in conclusion of $\phi$, and let $\sigma_u$ be a unifier of $\clause{\overline{u}'}$ and $\clause{u}$. Consider instead $P'=\phi[\phi']$, the proof obtained by replacing the resolution $\phi_1[\phi_\eta[\eta] \odot_{\sigma} \phi_u[u]] \odot_{\sigma_r}  \phi_r[r]$ with just $\phi' = \phi_\eta[\eta] \odot_{\sigma_{r'}} \phi_r[r]$ and maintaining the subsequent subproof of $\phi$. Note that all nodes of $\phi'$ contain $\clause{\overline{u}'}$. In particular, the final node in the proof $P'$ is $\clause{\overline{u}'}$ instead of $\clause{\bot}$. But then we can resolve against $\phi_u[u]$ using $\sigma_u$ to complete the proof.

Assume the result holds for all $|S|\le n$, and consider $|S|=n+1$. Assume that $S$ is defined as above, and is pairwise unifiable. Order the elements from the top of the proof to the bottom (and break ties left-right), so that $\clause{\eta_1}$ is the top-left-most premise resolved against $\clause{u}$. In particular, $\clause{\eta_1}$ contains $\clause{\overline{u}_1'}$, and we have that $P=\phi[\phi_1[\phi_{\eta_1}[\eta_1] \odot_{\sigma_1} \phi_u[u]] \odot_{\sigma_{r_1}} \phi_{r_1}[r_1]]$. Consider instead $\phi[\phi_1']$, the proof obtained by replacing the resolution $\phi_1[\phi_{\eta_1}[\eta_1] \odot_{\sigma_1} \phi_u[u]] \odot_{\sigma_{r_1}} \phi_{r_1}[r_1]$ with just $\phi_1' = \phi_{\eta_1}[\eta_1] \odot_{\sigma_{r_1'}} \phi_{r_1}[r_1]$ and maintaining the subproof of $\phi$. Note that all nodes of $\phi_1'$ contain $\overline{u}_1'$ still. In particular, the final node in the proof is $\clause{\overline{u}_1'}$ instead of $\clause{\bot}$.  

Consider $S'=S\setminus\clause{\eta_1}$: since $|S|=n+1>1$, $|S'| = |S|-1 \le n$. Apply the induction hypothesis to the premises in $S'$ to get a  resolution $\phi_2[\phi_{\eta_2}[\eta_2] \odot_{\sigma_2} \phi_u[u]] \odot_{\sigma_{r_2}} \phi_{r_2}[r_2]$ (where $\clause{\eta_2}$ contains $\clause{\overline{u}_2'}$);  we can construct $\phi_2' = \phi_{\eta_2}[\eta_2] \odot_{\sigma_{r_2'}} \phi_{r_2}[r_2]$. Consider  $\phi[\phi_2']$ and follow an argument similar to that for $\clause{\eta_1}$; the final proof node has $\clause{\overline{u}_1'} \cup \clause{\overline{u}_2'}$ instead of $\clause{\overline{u}_1'}$ where $\clause{\overline{u}_2'}$ is the result of the lower, after contraction, but before the final resolution with $\phi_u[u]$, applied by the induction hypothesis.  By assumption, $\clause{\overline{u}_1'}$ and $\clause{\overline{u}_2'}$ are pair-wise unifiable by some unifier $\sigma_{1,2}$. We can therefore contract $\sigma_{1,2}(\clause{\overline{u}_1'} \cup \clause{\overline{u}_2'})$ and call the result $\clause{\eta_{1,2}}$. Now $\clause{\eta_{1,2}}$ and $\clause{u}$ must be unifiable by assumption with some unifier $\sigma_u$, so we can replace the last node in the proof with $\phi_{\eta_{1,2}}[\eta_{1,2}]\odot_{\sigma_u} \phi_u[u]$ to complete the proof.
\end{proof}

\section{Recycle Pivots}
\subsection{Research Notes}

From the looks of some toy examples, I again conjecture we can recycle pivots when the formulas being moved are pairwise unifiable. Example from the video, trivially made first-order:

\begin{prooftree}
\def\e{\mbox{\ $\vdash$\ }}
\AxiomC{\e $A(X)C(Y)D(Z)$}
\AxiomC{$D(Z)$ \e $A(X)C(Y)$}
\BinaryInfC{\e $A(X)C(Y)$}
\AxiomC{$A(X)$ \e $C(Y)$}
\BinaryInfC{c:  \e $C(Y)$}

\AxiomC{$C(Y)$\e}
\AxiomC{$D(Z)$ \e $C(Y)$}
\BinaryInfC{$D(Z)$\e}
\AxiomC{$A(X) C(Y)$ \e $D(Z)$}
\BinaryInfC{$A(X)C(Y)$\e}

\BinaryInfC{$A(X)$\e}

\AxiomC{\e $A(X)$}

\BinaryInfC{$\bot$}

\end{prooftree}
