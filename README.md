Scavenger is an automated theorem prover based on the new **conflict resolution** calculus,
which lifts some aspects of the conflict-drive clause learning approach used by sat-solvers to
logics with quantifiers. 


### Usage Instructions

Tell your java virtual machine to use UTF-8 and more memory. You can do this by setting your environment variable with the following command:

```
  $ export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Xmx1024m -Xss4m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
```

(you may change the values after ```-Xmx```, ```Xss``` and ```XX:MaxPermSize=``` to suit your needs)

You must have [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html) (version >= 0.13) installed. SBT automatically downloads all compilers and libraries on which Scavenger depends.

To start SBT, go to Scavenger's home folder using the terminal and run:

```
  $ sbt
```

You can run scavenger within SBT's command line. With the following SBT command, scavenger will be compiled and executed, and a help message will be shown.

```  
  > scavenger --help
```

The following command runs scavenger on the 'examples/problems/CNF/SET006-1.cnfp'. The proof is written to 'refutation.proof'.
  

```
  > scavenger -a CR -f cnfp -o refutation.proof examples/problems/CNF/SET006-1.cnfp
```

To use scavenger from outside SBT, a jar file must be generated by executing the following command within SBT:

```
  > one-jar
```

The generated jar file can be deployed and used like any other java jar file:

```
  $ java -jar scavenger.jar -a CR -f cnfp -o refutation.proof examples/problems/CNF/SET006-1.cnfp
```
