Scavenger is an automated theorem prover based on the new **conflict resolution** calculus,
which lifts some aspects of the conflict-drive clause learning approach used by sat-solvers to
logics with quantifiers. 


###Usage Instructions###

Tell your java virtual machine to use UTF-8 and more memory. You can do this by setting your environment variable with the following command:

```
  $ export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Xmx1024m -Xss4m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
```

(you may change the values after ```-Xmx```, ```Xss``` and ```XX:MaxPermSize=``` to suit your needs)

You must have [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html) (version >= 0.13) installed. SBT automatically downloads all compilers and libraries on which Scavenger depends.

To start SBT, go to Scavenger's home folder using the terminal and run:

```
  $ sbt
```

You can run scavenger within SBT's command line. With the following SBT command, scavenger will be compiled and executed, and a help message will be shown.

```  
  > scavenger --help
```

The following command runs scavenger on the 'examples/problems/CNF/SET006-1.cnfp'. The proof is written to 'refutation.proof'.
  

```
  > scavenger -a CR -f cnfp -o refutation.proof examples/problems/CNF/SET006-1.cnfp
```

To use scavenger from outside SBT, a jar file must be generated by executing the following command within SBT:

```
  > one-jar
```

The generated jar file can be deployed and used like any other java jar file:

```
  $ java -jar scavenger.jar -a CR -f cnfp -o refutation.proof examples/problems/CNF/SET006-1.cnfp
```


###Scavenger as a Scala Library###

To import Scavenger as a library in your own Java or Scala projects,  
add the following line to your build.sbt file, if you are using [SBT](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Getting-Started-Setup) to manage the library dependencies of your project:

```
   libraryDependencies += "au.aossie" %% "scavenger" % "0.1"
```

or add the following lines to your pom.xml file, if you are using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) instead:

```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>au.aossie</groupId>
            <artifactId>scavenger_2.10</artifactId>
            <version>0.1</version>
        </dependency>
```

###Documentation###

Detailed theoretical descriptions of some of the algorithms implemented in Skeptik are available in our [papers](https://github.com/Paradoxika/Papers). There are also [slides](https://github.com/Paradoxika/Talks) of presentations about Skeptik.

Scaladoc documentation for the code can be generated by running the following command:

```
  sbt doc
```
