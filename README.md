Scavenger is an automated theorem prover based on 
the new **conflict resolution** calculus,
which lifts some aspects of the 
conflict-drive clause learning approach 
used by sat-solvers to logics with quantifiers. 


### Usage Instructions

You must have [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html) (version >= 1.0) installed. SBT automatically downloads all compilers and libraries on which Scavenger depends.

To start SBT, go to Scavenger's home folder using the terminal and run:

```
  $ sbt
```

You can run scavenger within SBT's command line. With the following SBT command, scavenger will be compiled and executed, and a help message will be shown.

```  
  > scavenger --help
```

The following command runs scavenger on the 'examples/problems/CNF/SET006-1.cnfp'. The proof is written to 'refutation.proof'.
  

```
  > scavenger -a EP -f cnfp -o refutation.proof examples/problems/CNF/SET006-1.cnfp
```

To use scavenger from outside SBT, a jar file must be generated by executing the following command within SBT:

```
  > assembly
```

The generated jar file can be deployed and used like any other java jar file:

```
  $ java -jar scavenger.jar -a EP -f cnfp -o refutation.proof examples/problems/CNF/SET006-1.cnfp
```

### Using Scavenger as a Library

Scavenger is currently available for Scala 2.12 only.

To import Scavenger as library in your Scala (or any other JVM-based language) project, just create the Scavenger
dependency by adding the following to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.aossie" %% "scavenger" % "0.2"
```

This will pull in every single Scavenger module. If you only require some of the functionality, you can
pick-and-choose from amongst these modules:

 * `scavenger-core`: Data structures for the logic and lambda calculus in general
 * `scavenger-prover`: Various algorithms for the theorem proving for first-order logic
 * `scavenger-cli`: Command Line Interface (as described above) which you probably do not need in your project

### Documentation

The calculus behind Scavenger is described in the [Conflict Resolution paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04568).
