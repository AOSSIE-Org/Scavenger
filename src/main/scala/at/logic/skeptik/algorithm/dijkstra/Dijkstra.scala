/**
 * mutable class Dijkstra implements (a slightly modified version of) Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
 * 
 * See for example Cormen, T., Leiserson, C., Rivest, R., & Stein, C. (2001). Introduction to algorithms. 
 * Retrieved from http://euler.slu.edu/~goldwasser/courses/loyola/comp363/2003_Spring/handouts/course-info.pdf
 * Page 595 for a description of the algorithm
 * 
 * the algorithm operates on graphs represented as objects of the WGraph class
 * takes two type parameters: T1 is the type of vertices in the graph
 *                            T2 is the type of edge-labels in the graph
 * 
 * the shortest path between vertices is computed and stored as EquationTree objects                           
 * theoretically the class should be independent of the special case of equations,
 * which would require paths objects of a generic type
 * this however turned out to be a little bit tricky and was therefore not dropped (for the moment)
 * 
 * Dijkstra's algorithm is extended by discounting certain edges
 * Since this class was designed to compute explanations and deduced equalities have explanations themselves,
 * some equalities in explanations can be used twice.
 * However, since they only occur once in the final explanation, 
 * they should not be counted twice when computing distances.
 * 
 * Therefore, during the process of computing explanations, certain equalities are discounted,
 * i.e. they have 1 less weight when contributing to another step in the shortest distance path
 * 
 * An idea for improvement:
 * The issue of double using equalities could also be solved by dynamically computing adjacent nodes
 * in the graph.
 * The Dijkstra algorithm relies heavily on adjacent nodes.
 * Should one equation be used in a deduction, all the left and right sides could be made adjacent.
